# Suicide_rates_1985-2016
 
Suicide is a serious public health issue that affects individuals, families, and communities worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 700,000 people die by suicide every year, making it the fourth leading cause of death among people aged 15-29 years. Furthermore, for every suicide death, there are many more individuals who attempt suicide but do not succeed.

The impact of suicide is not limited to the individual who dies by suicide, but also affects their loved ones and the wider community. Suicide can have a profound emotional, social, and economic impact on families and communities, and can contribute to feelings of fear, sadness, and hopelessness.

By analyzing suicide rates over time and identifying trends and patterns in the data, we can gain a better understanding of the factors that contribute to suicide and develop targeted prevention strategies to reduce the incidence of suicide. This project aims to contribute to this important goal by exploring suicide rates worldwide from 1985 to 2016. The insights gained from this analysis could inform the development of policies and interventions aimed at reducing the prevalence of suicide and improving mental health outcomes for individuals and communities.
